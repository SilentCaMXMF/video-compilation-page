            <h2>ðŸŽ¨ What is CSS?</h2>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  It's the language used to style and visually design HTML content on a web page. While HTML structures the content (headings, paragraphs, images, etc.), CSS controls how that content looksâ€”its colors, fonts, layout, spacing, responsiveness, and much more.</p>
            <p>CSS can Change fonts, colors, and text sizes. Add margins, padding, and borders. Create layouts using Flexbox and Grid.Make sites responsive to different screen sizes. Add transitions and animations</p>

            <h2>ðŸ§  What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript adds behavior and logic â€” like reacting to clicks, validating forms, creating animations, updating content without reloading the page, and more.</p>
            <p>
                With JavaScript, you can Show or hide elements (e.g., dropdown menus). Respond to user input (e.g., buttons, forms). Validate form data before itâ€™s sent. Create image sliders and carousels. Load new content without refreshing (using AJAX or fetch). Build full web applications (when combined with tools like React, Vue, or Node.js)
